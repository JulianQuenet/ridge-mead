# Game mechanics

This repository will serve as a preview/demo, decided to finish off the project on Unity, the games gets a bit laggy
when importing all the needed assests/models so this is just an unfished preview of a much bigger project, but at the moment 
the game is exclusively exploratory, the game takes about a minute or to so to load but the preview can be view here : https://ridge-mead.netlify.app/.
